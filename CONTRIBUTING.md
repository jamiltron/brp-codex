# CONTRIBUTING

Feel free to add any additional material in the form of a pull request. Just make sure to do due dilligence wrt licensing. If this is not something that is ORC Licensed, you will have to rewrite the implementation in your own voice. Please provide a source for anything you are replicating, even if rewritten, just so we can make sure to cross our T's and dot our I's.
