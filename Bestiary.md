## Goblinoid

### Orc

Orcs are bestial humanoids who despise humanity, elves, dwarves, and nearly any other people they encounter. They usually have grayish skin, fangs, and pointed ears, and are sometimes referred to as goblins. Orcs prefer darkness but can function well enough in daylight. They have a rough civilization based almost entirely on brutality and enslavement of their own as well as any unlucky captives. They even practice cannibalism on weak or unlucky members of their own species. Orcs often serve the forces of darkness, or prey upon others for their own amusement and enrichment. Some orcs ride giant wolves, bred as mounts. Many types of orcs could exist, based on environmental, cultural, regional, or other variances. Common types are the formidable ‘greater’ orcs (STR 5D6, CON 3D6+3, and SIZ 3D6+6) and pestilential ‘lesser’ orcs (STR 3D6, SIZ 2D6).

## Undead

### Skeleton

Animated skeletons are either created or summoned by magic or the result of an ancient curse. Most are human remains, but skeletons of other species exist. Animated skeletons are almost always encountered guarding some treasure, ancient tomb, or some other place of ill omen. Skeletons move at the same speed they did in life but cannot swim. They have no fatigue points and never tire.

| **STR** | **SIZ** | **INT** | **POW** | **DEX** |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 3D6     | 2D6+6   | 3D6     | 1       | 3D6     |
| 10–11   | 13      | 10–11   | 1       | 10–11   |
|                           |                                                                |

| **Move:** 10              | **Hit Points** 13 (see below)                                  |

**Attacks:**

-   Broadsword 55%, 1D8+1+dm (bleeding)

-   Large Round Shield 55%, 1D4+dm (knockback)

**Skills:** Dodge 40%

Skeletons have no CON, and their hit points equals their SIZ. They are immune to the special effects from bleeding and impaling hits. They take no damage whatsoever from thrusting weapons, unless the hit was a special success or critical hit, in which case, the damage is taken but the secondary effects are ignored.

Dried bones are brittle, and snap and splinter easily from a heavy blow. Regardless of the skeleton’s current hit points, any blow striking a skeleton has a percentage chance of destroying the skeleton equal to the damage done multiplied by ×4, in addition to the normal hit point loss. If the roll is successful, the skeleton instantly shatters to shards of bone.

_e.g. If a mace blow strikes a skeleton for 5 points of damage, there is a 20% chance the skeleton is immediately shattered._
