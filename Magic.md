# Magic

## Blast

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to attack a single target with a beam of magic energy. The target takes 1D6 damage per level. Under most circumstances, non-magical armor absorbs the damage, and this spell can be dodged. If Blast is parried with a shield, the shield takes the damage, with any remainder going to the target.

Countermagic may stop Blast, but Protection does not work. Resistance does not work against Blast.

Change

**Range:** 30 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to change a targeted being or object into a variety of shapes from the same relative type (animal to animal, vegetable to vegetable, mineral to mineral, etc.). Each level affects 3 SIZ of the target if the magician can overcome the target’s POW in a resistance roll. If the target is willing (or the magician themself), no resistance roll is required. To target something larger than 3 SIZ, use enough levels to affect the creature or object’s full SIZ. The targeted being is then transformed into a creature or object of that exact SIZ. The new shape has the outward attributes and limitations of the shape (including natural abilities, if any), but characteristics remain unchanged. Whenever applicable, the target’s characteristics and skills are used, or the base rating in a newly acquired skill (such as Fly).

Chapter 11: Creatures describes a variety of sample creatures. Either use the standard writeup or customize one if it is used regularly. If estimating a creature’s capabilities, assume that large claws do 1D6 plus damage modifier, and a bite or horn will do 1D3 plus damage modifier.

If the target has already taken hit point damage before the spell is cast, the new form appears in a similarly wounded state. Similarly, any power points, fatigue, or other conditions existing on the target are not affected, as appropriate.

In addition to the number of SIZ points this spell can affect, additional levels can be used to affect more than one object (for example, casting one spell to affect two or more beings, provided enough SIZ is covered), or extending the duration of the spell by 15 minutes. When the spell is cast, the magician should specify how additional levels of the spell are being used.

Conjure (type) Elemental

**Range:** 12 meters

**Duration:** 10 combat rounds

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1 per point of elemental POW

This spell conjures or dismisses a specific type of elemental, chosen when the spell is taken. For the duration of the spell, the elemental must be directed by the magician’s full attention. Each point of POW the elemental possesses costs 1 power point.

The following elementals are described in Chapter 11: Creatures.

    Air: Called sylphs, they usually appear as beautiful, near-transparent humanoids, either naked or clad in diaphanous clothing. They have transparent wings, either feathered or like those of an insect. They usually glide aboveground.
    Earth: Called gnomes, they are usually thick-bodied humanoid beings made of earth and rock, frequently male, with mossy beards and roots that cross their bodies like veins.
    Fire: Called salamanders, they usually appear as hairless humanoids wreathed in fire, with darkened skin glowing in cracks from within. Alternately, they appear as reptiles or serpents.
    Water: Called undines, and often appear as beautiful mermaids, half-fish and half-human, pale green and blue. When they appear on land, their fishtails are replaced with human legs.

Elementals may appear in entirely different forms, and other types may exist.

Control

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 10 combat rounds

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to control the thoughts and/or actions of one intelligent being. The magician must succeed in a POW vs. POW resistance roll against the target. Each level of the spell allows the magician to control one being. This spell cannot be used on unintelligent animals. Each attack is independent with a POW vs. POW roll made against each target. The magician must concentrate on the spell, using no other spells or doing anything more than moving slowly and speaking briefly, or the target will simply stand idle. The magician must make an Idea roll if distracted,

The magician controls the movements and speech of the target(s). The target cannot speak or perform any voluntary action other than those specified, but if the magician wishes, the target can speak freely or have a limited range of free actions. Having more than one target do different things requires an Idea roll each combat round to maintain coordination between different targets. If the magician is forced to fight or concentrates on any other activity, the target(s) collapses into sleep. Once control is lost, a collapsed target will revive and regain control with a roll of CON×1. The roll may be attempted once each combat round after collapsing.

If the target is commanded to perform an action it would normally find objectionable, a Difficult Idea lets it resist. Success means that the target balks and does not follow the order for one combat round, standing still or otherwise idling. Failure means the target performs the action as required. The action can be commanded again in the following round, with a new Idea roll. If the action commanded is wholly objectionable, such as murder of an ally, the Idea roll is unmodified. If the command is suicidal, the Idea roll is Easy. If the result of the Idea roll is a special success, the target breaks free from the Control spell in an obvious fashion. If the result of the Idea roll is a critical success, the target breaks free unbeknownst to the spell’s caster.

When the Control spell is done, the target may make an Idea roll. If successful, they remember every detail of actions taken under the spell’s influence. They do not necessarily remember who the spellcaster was, unless it is obvious.

Countermagic

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to create a magical shield around the magician or any desired subject they wish to keep magic from affecting. Any incoming spell must have its level overcome the level of the Countermagic on the resistance table. If the attacking spell’s resistance roll succeeds, the spell penetrates the Countermagic, but must still overcome the POW of the target, if required. If it does not require a resistance roll, it acts as if no Countermagic spell was cast. If the Countermagic spell succeeds on the resistance table, the incoming spell has rebounded on the original caster. If that caster has Countermagic on themself, the spell must overcome that Countermagic to have an effect. Any spell failing to penetrate two Countermagic spells dissipates and is no more. Countermagic protects the target and anything they are carrying, within reason (if in doubt, use the character’s STR as a guideline as to how much they can carry).

If the character or object to receive the Countermagic already has a Protection spell, the Countermagic is not effective unless its level overcomes the level(s) of Protection on the resistance table. If successful, both spells take effect. Countermagic is effective vs. Blast and Lightning, but not against Fire or Frost.

Dark

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to dampen all light within a circle 3 meters in radius plus 3 meters per level. This darkness is absolute, and light cannot shine through it. The spell must be cast on an object; it does not hang in mid-air. The affected area is in total darkness to anyone seeing in the normal range of visible light, even if a torch or other light source is active within the spell’s radius. Dark can be cast on an object that Light has previously been cast upon. Each level of Dark cancels a single level of Light.

Diminish

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to overcome the target’s POW with a resistance roll and reduce their STR, CON, SIZ or DEX by –1 per level of the spell. Pick which of the target’s characteristics will be affected before the spell is cast. Subsequent casts can reduce the same characteristic or affect a different characteristic. This spell affects any attributes derived from these characteristics, such as hit points, power points, characteristic rolls, characteristic modifiers, etc. Characteristics cannot be reduced below 1, and points of Diminish more than that have no further effect.

Dispel

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this power to rid oneself (or another target) of detrimental or positive effects of a spell. Like Countermagic, it must overcome the level of the spell on the resistance table. Dispel must be directed at a particular spell in effect on the target. Identify the spell’s effects to be eliminated (if numerous magic effects are in place, the gamemaster decides which are affected). If the target is protected by Countermagic, it must get through the Countermagic to affect the target. If the Dispel is intended to be effective against multiple spells, the spell’s level is rolled against each of them on the resistance table. In the case of multiple targets, the caster must either specify whether the Dispel is intended to work against a single spell or all of them.
If multiple spells are to be dispelled, the one with the highest levels is checked first against the Dispel power on the resistance table. Any effects that are not dispelled remain, and any failure to Dispel a spell means that the Dispel spell ceases working and cannot be pitted against further spells.

Dispel can also be used against someone as they cast another spell, to prevent the spell from being cast. This is handled in the Statement of Intent phase of combat. With a successful Luck roll, a magician who can act in the round, but has not already done so, can abandon their intended action and attempt to use Dispel against a spell as it is cast. Dispel can be used as a held action. To interrupt a spell from being cast, the magician must cast equal or higher levels in Dispel or the Dispel doesn’t work.

Dispel can also be used to banish or destroy lesser summoned creatures (elementals or minor demons) or a possessor (for example, a being that has seized control over a host’s body using the Control spell). In these cases, the Dispel’s levels are compared against the creature’s own POW characteristic. If the creature’s POW is overcome on the resistance table, it departs as quickly as possible. If it is a possessing being, the creature flees the host body immediately. If multiple appropriate beings are within the range of the spell, you must clarify which one is being targeted, or all of them are targeted, with the highest POW being the one attempted first. If the Dispel succeeds on the first, it then moves to the second, etc. If it fails, it does not have further effect on any remaining beings.

Dull

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to reduce the attack chance of a weapon by –5% and its damage by –1 point. More than one level can either reduce the attack chance more (to –10%, –15%, etc.) or reduce damage by –2, –3, etc., or it can be distributed equally among several weapons up the level of the spell and within range. If a weapon leaves the range, it is no longer affected. Damage cannot be reduced below 1 point, and a roll of 01% always hits, regardless of modifiers.

Enhance

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to overcome the target’s POW in a resistance roll and add +1 to one of the target’s STR, CON, SIZ or DEX per level of the spell. Pick which of the target’s characteristics will be affected before the spell is cast. Subsequent castings can increase the same characteristic or affect a different characteristic. This will temporarily affect other attributes derived from these characteristics, such as hit points, power points, characteristic rolls, characteristic modifiers, etc. Hit points and power points above the target’s normal range are lost.

Fire

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to create a pillar of fire doing 1D6 fire damage to everything in a circle 1 meter in diameter. Multiple levels may be used to set up several fires instead of one large fire or can combine the effects.

A target can attempt to dodge out of the affected area. The spell’s damage is absorbed by armor, Protection, and Resistance spells, but Countermagic has no effect. The spell lasts only one combat round unless cast on or consuming something flammable. If so, the blaze continues, damaging anyone or anything within it at the rate of 1D4 points per combat round (see Fire and Heat).

Levels of this spell can be used to cancel levels of Frost on the resistance table, but Fire has no effect against other forms of supernatural cold.

Frost

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to create a pillar of intense cold doing 1D6 cold damage per level to everything in a circle 1 meter in diameter. Multiple levels may be used to set up several frosted areas instead of one large one, or can combine the effects.

A target can attempt to dodge out of the affected area. The spell’s damage is absorbed by armor, Protection, and Resistance spells, but Countermagic has no effect. The spell lasts only one combat round unless something brittle is frozen. In this case, the brittle item may shatter (see Cold and Exposure).

Levels of this spell can be used to cancel levels of Fire on the resistance table, but Frost has no effect against other forms of supernatural flame.

Heal

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

This spell heals 1D6 hit points of damage per level. Restoring a character to a positive hit point total with Heal can restore them to life if successfully cast by the end of the round following that in which the victim suffered the mortal wound. Any limbs severed or lost through a major wound or use of the hit location system are still severed or lost, though the hit points are still restored. Heal has no effect on disease, poison, or radiation, though it can restore lost hit points caused by them.

Illusion

**Range:** 30 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to create up to 3 SIZ points per level of an object’s appearance. This is visual only, with no sound, scent, touch, or taste. If touched, it remains but is insubstantial. Illusions can be used to mislead or terrify opponents, or entrap them, disguising walls, concealing traps, etc. The illusion is immobile unless the caster concentrates on the illusion to the exclusion of all else. Those witnessing an illusion may attempt to detect the falsehood in one of several manners, depending on the circumstances:

    If the illusion should have sound, a successful Idea roll reveals it. If the illusion does not need sound, a Difficult Spot roll is required to see through it. If some form of sound accompanies the illusion, a Difficult Listen or Sense roll is required to notice it is not real.
    If the viewer suspects it is an illusion and attempts to disbelieve it, roll the magician’s POW vs. the viewer’s INT on the resistance table.

Invisibility

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to turn 3 SIZ per level of an object or another being invisible. Items or living beings cannot be turned partially invisible, though components can if the object consists of more than one “piece”.

The magician must concentrate on the spell and must do no more than walk or speak to maintain the invisibility. Fighting, taking injury, using another power, performing some athletic maneuver, or similar distractions break the effects and end the spell. Any attacks against an invisible character or object are at 1/5 the attacker’s skill rating. Any parries are equally difficult, requiring a successful Listen, Sense, or Spot roll to even make the attempt. This power does not stop sound or other sensory clues from the target, and successful use of a Listen, Sense, or Spot skill reduces the penalty of attacks to Difficult instead of 1/5.

An invisible character can move, attack, flee, or stand still while the spell is active. Invisibility can be dispelled by the magician at any time, though starting it again requires another casting.

Lift

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to lift 3 SIZ per level of an object or being and move it through the air. This spell can be cast on oneself, using it to fly. The target of the spell is moved up to 24 meters per combat round. Each level of the spell above the minimum necessary to move the SIZ add +6 meters movement per combat round. No resistance roll is required for weight equal to or below the number of SIZ affected by the spell (for example, casting Lift 4 allows your character to manipulate up to 12 points of SIZ without needing to make a roll on the resistance table). If the target does not wish to be lifted (or is held by or connected to something), the magician must overcome its POW or SIZ with a resistance roll (gamemaster choice).

The spell may also be used to slow a falling object that is otherwise too large for the level of the spell. For each level less than needed, the object is slowed as if it were falling that difference times 3 meters, up to a 12-meter reduction.

The spell may also move an object such as cart or sledge along the ground. In this case, each level of the spell can affect 6 SIZ of the targeted object or character. This spell can also be used to throw an object already lifted, with a Difficult roll of the caster’s Throw skill.

Light

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to illuminate a circle 3 meters per level in radius. This light is around the brightness of a torch or small light bulb. The spell must be cast on an object; it does not hang in mid-air. Light can be cast on an object that has had Dark previdously cast upon it, canceling both spells on a level-for-level basis.

Lightning

**Range:** 60 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to throw a lightning bolt doing 1D6 damage per level directly to the hit points of the desired target (usually a living being). If cast, the spell will hit if not dodged or parried. If two targets are equally close, the Lightning strikes the target wearing or wielding the most metal. Countermagic protects against the spell, and other insulation may protect the character (gamemaster’s discretion). When used on a metallic object, Lightning has a chance equal to the magician’s POW multiplied by its level of traveling (and jumping) along any connected or nearby metallic surface to strike any other characters touching the metal surface for ½ damage. Additionally, it can “fry” any electronic equipment it targets, using the magician’s POW against the item’s hit points in a resistance roll.

A target can dodge or parry Lightning with a shield. Dodging lightning is Difficult if wearing metal armor, and if Lightning is parried successfully with a non-metallic shield, the shield takes the damage, with any remainder carrying over to the target. Parrying Lightning with a metallic shield is useless, as the Lightning conducts through the shield and to the target.

Perception

**Range:** 60 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to point out the direction of the nearest example of one type of thing (specified by the caster when the spell is cast), such as the nearest trap, secret door, gold, magic, stairway, unfamiliar thoughts, etc. within range. Additional levels let the caster seek out more than one thing at the same time. The gamemaster can determine if similar things are close enough to count.

For example, Perception 2 can find the closest two traps, or it may find the closest trap and the closest secret door.

Protection

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to add +1 point per level to the target’s armor points (even if no armor is worn). Any Countermagic cast upon on the target must overcome the Protection spell on the resistance table. If successful, both spells remain on the target and in effect. At your gamemaster’s discretion, this spell can also provide protection against damage types not normally blocked by armor.

Resistance

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to gain 1 point of resistance per level against damage taken from extremes of temperature or the environment, such as Fire or Frost spells. If the protected character is hit by more than one such attack, each damage roll is reduced by the level of the effect.

Protection and Resistance

Protection and Resistance apparently serve the same purpose: keeping your character from taking damage, but they do differ.

    Protection is like armor and is subtracted from any physical damage taken, but it is not effective against environmental extremes.
    Resistance lowers the amount of damage taken by environmental extremes (heat, cold), but is not effective against attacks or physical damage.

Some attacks, such as a flaming sword or a falling flaming roof beam, may be affected by both spells at once, with Protection reducing the points of damage from the blade itself, and Resistance reducing the extra damage from the flames.

Seal

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to bond the edges of any two inanimate objects which are at rest and fitted to one another, such as a door in a door frame, a lid on a box, or a knife in a sheath. The two objects become joined as if they were one object and cannot be separated while the spell is in effect. The objects can be battered open or destroyed, their hit points and other values combined, when applicable. Seal adds +20 hit points to the combined hit point total of the two items.

Each level adds either 15 minutes to the duration of the spell or adds +20 additional hit points to the hit points of the sealed objects. The caster may split levels between these two benefits, deciding how before casting the spell.

Sharpen

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to add +5% to the attack chance and +1 damage to any weapon (including blunt weapons and missile weapons) it is successfully applied to, up to the maximum damage possible using that weapon. Additional levels can either add multiples of +5% and +1 point of damage to the weapon (+10% and +2 damage, +15% and +3 damage, etc.), or can be distributed equally among several weapons, up to the level of the spell and within range.

For example, Sharpen 6 can be used to add +5% and +1 damage to all six bullets in a revolver.

The damage bonus is only applied to the weapon’s natural range of damage, with the user’s damage modifier (if applicable) applied separately, unmodified by the spell.

Speak to Mind

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 10 combat rounds

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to speak to one other mind per level, whether intelligent or not. Only surface conversation or feelings are transmitted, and the target may need to make an Idea roll to understand if not traditionally intelligent. Language is not a barrier to this spell, however. Multiple targets of the spell cannot communicate to each other using this spell, though casting Speak to Mind 1 on a target, lets them communicate with one other mind.

Teleport

**Range:** 1,000 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use Teleport to instantaneously teleport 3 SIZ per level from its current location to another place within range. Only complete objects can be teleported—it is impossible to teleport a part of a living being away. If an object is not directly affixed to another object, it can be teleported.

For example, a gun can be teleported out of a target’s holster, but not the engine block out of a car.

Additional levels above the target’s SIZ can be used to increase the range by an additional +1,000 meters. If the target of the spell is affixed to something or is a living being that does not wish to be transported, the caster must overcome the item’s hit points (or armor value) vs. their POW on the resistance table. For a living target, the target’s POW is the opposing force. A willing target (such as oneself) does not require a resistance roll.

A fumble may send the item or person being teleported into a solid object, perhaps even underground. The caster should attempt a Luck roll if a fumble has been rolled. If the Luck roll is successful, no damage or ill effects are taken, and the teleported character or object narrowly escapes a grim fate. If the roll fails, the unlucky target immediately takes 3D6 points of damage and suffers an injury from the Major Wound Table, modified as appropriate.

Attempting to Teleport a foe or item into a solid structure allows the target the same chances as described above (a Luck roll). It costs 3 power points per level to consciously teleport something or someone into a solid structure or object (plus a 0/1D3 Sanity roll). If the subject of the teleportation into a solid substance is another item, your gamemaster decides what happens. A living being becoming fused with a solid item is usually traumatic, and the target must find some means of extricating themselves from the item or structure (such as another Teleport spell). Failure to do so can cause any Major Wound (as above) to have permanent effect.

Unseal

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to open unlocked doors or boxes and cause weapons to fly out of their sheaths and drop to the ground. It will not undo a locked container, or some object that has been fastened shut. It can be cast to cancel Seal if the level of Unseal overcomes the level of Seal on the resistance table.

Vision

**Range:** 100/10 meters

**Duration:** 10 combat rounds

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to see what is happening in any area within 100 meters of a familiar area, or within 10 meters of an unfamiliar area. This gives full vision and hearing, as if in that area, allowing that point of view to have any mobility they possess, while within the spell’s range. A caster physically near an area within the 10-meter range can cast it into that area, regardless of familiarity.

Each additional level allows viewing of a place or events that have transpired for up to +1 additional day. When viewing an area, the caster’s perception of time is unaltered—10 combat rounds of the spell take 10 combat rounds to view—but can be ended at any time by the caster.

This spell may also be used to touch an item and receive a vision of its previous user or owner. Each additional level used gives another use or another mental image. When casting, designate how to allocate extra levels. Furthermore, each level of this spell allows a cumulative 10% chance of learning the activating word for a magical device. This spell can only be attempted once for any single object until the spell’s skill ranking is increased by at least +5%.

While using the Vision spell, the caster may not use any other spell or the Vision spell’s effects end.

Wall

**Range:** 12 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to form a wall-like barrier out of the ground, formed from one particular type of available material that would normally be able to be sculpted into such a wall, such as earth, snow, ice, stone, metal, wood, concrete, gravel, sand, etc. The wall usually appears immediately before the caster to protect them against attacks or attackers, though it can appear anywhere within range. When created, the barrier is 1 square meter per level of the spell. These square meters can be distributed as desired along the dimensions of width, height, and length.

For example, casting Wall 9 and spending 9 power points lets the caster create a wall 3 meters high, 1 meter thick, and 3 meters long or 1 meter high, 1 meter thick, and 9 meters long.

This wall can be shaped in whatever simple form desired, such as a straight or curved wall, a half-sphere, etc.

Regardless of the substance it is made of, a Wall has 30 hit points. Each additional level above and beyond those defining its size adds +30 hit points to its hit point total, though an attacker generally only needs to destroy one or two 1-meter segments to create adequate space to move through it. At the end of the spell’s duration, the Wall dissolves, crumbles, melts, retracts into the earth, or gradually disappears, as appropriate.

If desired, the Wall’s 30 hit point value can be based on the guidelines in the Armor Values of Substances and Object SIZ Examples tables.

Ward

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Permanent

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use Ward to form a protective square of up to nine square meters around the person or object needing guarding or protection. The Ward is defined by four objects (called the wards) enchanted in a preliminary ritual to gain the effect. These wards do not gain any magical enhancement other than being attuned to one another for the purpose of the spell. Ward acts as a combination of Countermagic and Blast. Any power points passing through the region defined by Ward (in either direction) must overcome Countermagic 1. Any object crossing the line from either direction receives Blast 1. Each extra level adds +3 meters to any dimension of the area defined by the ward, or another level of Countermagic and Blast. The spell must be successfully cast to set up the wards and successfully cast again to take them down without harming the caster. The spell’s effects last until the wards are moved by the original caster, or destroyed, or the spell is dispelled.

Only the caster may move the ward objects without disturbing the spell. However, Dispel may be cast upon them. Physically interfering with the objects sets off the Countermagic and Blast capabilities, as if the Ward was triggered. If some other means of manipulating the objects is attempted, each ward has 30 hit points and acts as if it had Seal cast upon it.

Wounding

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to cause 1D6 points of magic damage per level directly to the target. Wounding requires a successful Brawl roll to touch the target in combat, or an Agility roll if not in combat. Either roll becomes Easy if the target is unsuspecting. Armor does not protect against this damage, though any Protection subtracts from the spell’s damage. The Brawl attack does not do any damage, regardless of what powers or weapons are being used, and it may be parried, dodged, or blocked as per a normal Brawl attack.
