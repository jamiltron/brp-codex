# Sorcery

## Augmentation Spells

### Cloak of Night (1-4)

_Source: BRP:UGE v1.0.3, pg. 83_

**Range:** Touch, Sight, etc.

Each level increases the target’s Hide skill by +20%, cumulative, for the duration.

## Characteristic Spells

### Lightning Speed (1-3)

_Source: BRP:UGE v1.0.3, pg. 85_

Range: Touch

The target’s MOV is increased by +1 per level of the spell while the spell is in effect. The spell can be cast on another species, such as a horse. Lightning Speed does not affect DEX.

When casting Lightning Speed 3 for the maximum increase of +3 points, roll D100. On a result of 00, the effect becomes permanent, and those points are permanently added to the target’s MOV. However, after that, the spell does not affect the target anymore, and they become unable to have it cast upon them again. They must also subtract 9 points permanently from other characteristics, in any combination, adjusting any values calculated from those characteristics. If allegiance is used, add +1D8 allegiance to whatever force represents randomness and/or change.

## Combat Spells

### Hell’s Razor (1–4)

_Source: BRP:UGE v1.0.3, pg. 84_

**Range:** Touch

This spell can be cast on a single slashing weapon with a cutting edge or edges, such as swords, axes, etc. The effects only apply to blows from edged weapons; if cast on a blunt or impaling weapon, it has no effect unless used in a slashing fashion. Each level increases the damage roll by +1, up to the maximum damage possible using that weapon. This does not change the wielder’s damage modifier (rolled separately).

## Manipulative Spells

### Pox (1)

_Source: BRP:UGE v1.0.3, pg. 86_

**Range:** Sight

This spell attacks the target’s power points, weakening them magically by overcoming the target with a successful current power point vs. current power point resistance roll. If successful, the target loses 1D6 power points; those lost points will regenerate normally. At 0 power points, a target immediately falls unconscious and cannot act. If the resistance roll is successful, the spell has no effect and the target’s power points are not lost.

## Occult Spells

### Ward (3)

_Source: BRP:UGE v1.0.3, pg. 89_

Range: Touch, Sight, etc.

As this spell is cast, the sorcerer must walk and define a line of 15 meters or less in length, or a circle of 15 meters or less in diameter. Afterwards, the sorcerer will become automatically aware the first time any enemy crosses the line or enters the circle. Once the spell is cast, it is ready to go but does not actually activate until the line is crossed. No further effort is required to maintain the spell, and for a little-traveled path or area, it might take years before anyone sets it off and alerts the caster. Spells like Witch Sight or other means of detecting sorcery or magic can identify a Ward. Undo Sorcery 3 eliminates a Ward.

## Utility Spells

### Vermin's Vision (1)

_Source: BRP:UGE v1.0.3, pg. 88_

**Range:** Touch, Sight, etc.

The sorcerer can share in and control the vision of one rat, mouse, or similar vermin, chosen from within eyesight. If the target animal is lost from view, the spell continues for the rest of its duration, and can be extended with subsequent castings of the same spell. If no vermin are present when the spell is cast, it does not work. Your gamemaster should announce beforehand when there are no vermin within eyesight.
